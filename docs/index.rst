F5 BIG-IP Automation Config Converter (BIG-IP ACC)
==================================================
| BIG-IP ACC converts configuration files to either an `F5 BIG-IP Application Services 3 Extension (BIG-IP AS3) <https://clouddocs.f5.com/products/extensions/f5-appsvcs-extension/latest/>`_
| or an `F5 BIG-IP Declarative Onboarding (BIG-IP DO) <https://clouddocs.f5.com/products/extensions/f5-declarative-onboarding/latest/>`_ declaration. The source code for BIG-IP ACC can be found on `GitHub <https://github.com/f5devcentral/f5-automation-config-converter/releases>`_.
* BIG-IP AS3 configures applications and services on a BIG-IP device that already has its initial settings.
* BIG-IP DO conversions configure system settings such as licensing and provisioning, network settings such as VLANs and Self IPs, and clustering settings.
| Conversions are based on supported classes.  For a list of the objects that are converted, see :ref:`Classes<classes>`.
| BIG-IP ACC is a community-supported offering. Please use `GitHub Issues <https://github.com/f5devcentral/f5-automation-config-converter/issues>`_ to submit an issue for our team.
